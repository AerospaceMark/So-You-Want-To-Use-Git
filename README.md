# So, You Want to Use Git?
This is a Git tutorial for everyone who is either new to Git or has tried to learn and found it confusing, perhaps deciding to learn "some other day". Well, today can be that day!

To get started, click on the "So You Want To Learn Git.pdf" file and then in the new web page that appears click the "Download" button. Welcome to Git!

# Why was this tutorial written?
Git is a useful tool designed to help you write better code, work with files, and collaborate with others. It does this by keeping track of changes that you make to your files and allowing you to easily access old versions. Git also enables you to work with others on a common project by letting everyone access the files, make improvements, and then merge all the improvements back into the original project. Git is used by individuals, large corporations, and everyone in between.

However, Git has a notoriously steep learning curve. If you’ve tried learning Git in the past, you may have been faced with a mess of command line text, never quite understanding what was happening. It’s hard to keep trudging through that, and that’s where this tutorial comes in handy. This tutorial aims to teach the reader how to use Git by first explaining what Git is and how it will benefit them, and then demonstrating click by click how to interface with the common online Git providers GitHub and GitLab, all without opening the terminal.

After the reader is comfortable using an online Git provider, the subsequent sections then demonstrate how to use Git on a Desktop through GitKraken and then finally the terminal. These are elaborately described with screenshots showing every step. The section that uses the terminal shows every line that must be used and explains the inputs and outputs in plain terms.

You may have noticed how long this tutorial appears to be. However, this tutorial is designed to be cherry-picked to meet your personal Git goals. If you just want a place to store files and track how they change over time, feel free to read the few pages that describe either GitHub or GitLab and then put the tutorial down. If you want an in-depth experience on how to work in teams and do it all from the terminal, feel free to read just the sections about the terminal, and then go to the Further Learning section listed at the end to expand your knowledge. If you want something in between, or are just exploring, feel free to read any sections you want. For example, if you’re only interested in GitHub, then you’ll only need to read 24 pages of this tutorial, of which a large amount is devoted to screenshots helping you along the way.

This tutorial was originally written for a research group in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Brigham Young University (BYU). While working on this tutorial it became clear that this could be useful beyond our research group.

# What's covered in this tutorial?
This tutorial focuses on teaching Git through using the following common approaches:

- GitHub
- GitLab
- GitKraken
- The Terminal / Command Line

This tutorial will teach you how to use Git for personal and team purposes using each of these approaches. Although it covers all of these approaches, the reader needs to only read those sections that are most relevant to them. For example, if you are interested in using GitHub to store your files online but also want to use the command line for daily use on your computer then feel free to just read the sections about GitHub and the terminal.

# Why Microsoft Word?
This tutorial is originally written in Microsoft Word. This decision was originally made because future editors are more likely to be proficient in Microsoft Word than LaTeX. However, because .docx documents are not easily converted into plain text files, this Git repository is actually quite large. It is likely that in the future this will be converted into a LaTeX-based project and the repository will be restructured accordingly.

Because this repository is so large, it is recommended that you download only the "So You Want To Use Git.pdf" file by clicking on it and then hitting the download icon.
